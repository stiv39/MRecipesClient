      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        Like most website operators, mrecipes.sk collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
        browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
        and the date and time of each visitor request. mrecipes.sk’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how mrecipes.sk’s visitors use its website. From time to time,
        mrecipes.sk may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report
        on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p>
        mrecipes.sk also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
        for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.mrecipes.sk blog posts. mrecipes.sk only
        discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
        personally-identifying information as described below.
